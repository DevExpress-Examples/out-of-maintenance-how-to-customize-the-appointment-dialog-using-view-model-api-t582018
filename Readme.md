# How to customize the Appointment Dialog using View Model API


<p>View Model API enables you to customize dialog element characteristics (values, availability, and a layout) as needed, without the necessity of overriding <a href="https://docs.devexpress.com/AspNetMvc/DevExpress.Web.Mvc.SchedulerExtension">Scheduler</a>'s commands and copying dialog form templates (UserControls) into your project.</p>
<p>This example illustrates how to customize the Appointment Dialog content (changing the editor's type, visibility, captions, and font settings) using Model View API as described in the "How to customize Appointment Dialog using View Model API" topic. </p>
